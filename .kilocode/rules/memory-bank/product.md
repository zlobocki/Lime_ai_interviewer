# Product Context: Next.js Starter Template

## Why This Template Exists

Starting a new Next.js project involves boilerplate setup, configuration decisions, and establishing patterns. This template provides a clean, opinionated starting point that eliminates setup friction and establishes best practices from the start. It's optimized for AI-assisted development, where an AI can quickly extend the template based on user requirements.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Setup Time**: Eliminates boilerplate configuration (TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint)
2. **Decision Fatigue**: Pre-made choices for tooling and patterns
3. **AI Context**: Memory bank provides persistent context for AI assistants
4. **Extensibility**: Recipe system for adding common features
5. **Consistency**: Standardized project structure and conventions

## How It Should Work (User Flow)

1. User starts with this template
2. User describes what they want to build to AI assistant
3. AI adds pages, components, and features as needed
4. AI uses recipes for common additions (database, auth)
5. User previews changes via hot reload
6. Iterate until satisfied
7. Deploy

## Key User Experience Goals

- **Zero to Feature Fast**: Get building immediately, no setup required
- **AI-Friendly**: Memory bank and recipes make AI assistance effective
- **Flexible Foundation**: Can become any type of application
- **Best Practices Built-In**: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, clean structure

## What This Template Provides

1. **Clean App Structure**: Single page ready for expansion
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript setup with strict mode
3. **Modern Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 ready to use
4. **Code Quality**: ESLint configured
5. **Extensibility**: Recipe system for common features

## Integration Points

- **Database**: Use add-database recipe for Drizzle + SQLite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS pre-configured
- **AI Assistance**: Memory bank for context persistence
